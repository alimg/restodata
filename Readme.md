What is this?

This is a machine learning platform for cafes and dinners. It predicts how many orders and what kind of orders will there be in a given day and hour. It also helps(!) you for collecting statistical data. All this code is written within 48 hours. Use at your own risk.

How this works?

It works with sound. Idea is, there is a mobile app that will listen to your shop to recognize any order made by customers and will send them to the cloud app for processing. It should give better results as it collects more data from your shop. It also needs whats in the menu to understand the order.
